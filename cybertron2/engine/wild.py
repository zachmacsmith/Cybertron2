"""The wild layer in the engine (proposals/wild_layer.md §3, §4; D2-199, the ecology branch): only in a world with the `wild` pack.

- **At world build** (`seed`): the land summary the generator wrote (`spec["wild"]["land"]`) and a starting state, run forward
  through a history before the run (§3.9: the same step with no people, on the world's own climate at days far ahead of the run, so
  the past does not repeat the run's weather). Kept in `s["wild"]`.
- **Each night** (`night`, called after farm.night): the ecology step for the day (cybertron2/wild/ecology.py), with the weather at
  each area's node (D4-111) and keyed draws (`w.rng`), written back by the `set_wild` primitive so the journal holds every change.
- **The bridge out** (§3.8): what wild kinds ate of the people's crops and stores in a node's home area is drawn from the standing
  crops and the stores there, through the engine's own primitives. A share of the model's crop eaten is the share drawn from the
  real crop, so no unit has to match.

Hunts, groups near people, traces and signs come in phase 3 (wild_layer.md §6).
